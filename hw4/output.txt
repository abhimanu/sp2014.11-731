defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security , and will bring financial chain reaction of the pentagon corridors to the fields of battle in afghanistan on the line and the civil assembly .
" the effects of these reductions will be devastating for the ministry of , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке and john mccain , ariz. , lindsey graham , south carolina .
" so , will make such a strong decline , the majority of our projects кораблестроению and construction of the unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undercut the trust of those who support our army and will seriously damage to the alert . "
" even though military financing in the foreign emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , military , to be severely affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta .
" staff will be reduced , leading to the staff опозданиям with payments military suppliers , and legal and political support will be disrupted . "
" consequence of sequestration in the ministry of defense will be quick decline of the united states as the world 's leading military power . "
" this is not an option , with which we live in , and this is not the way , that we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta a letter or recent warnings of senators will lead to strengthen calls for release of the pentagon from cuts or fiscal compromise , we 'll see later .
at a press conference last week , defense minister painted a gloomy picture of what could be further -- the troops with puppetry , but without the kernel .
" it 's a paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers that can accomplish the mission " , " panetta said in his introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the most big defense projects may face obstacles , including those that passed the tests , and some only on the early planning stages .
halting further development and test f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say this is the vital next step to improve and counter potential threats , china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows how serious are and повсеместны deception and lies in the daily life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании , as they allegedly hid that retirement retired football coach raped boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial machinations , during the campaign , connected with the укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories about the fraud charges on exams in high school and college - standard affair .
mentors who must be to teach the opposite , sends a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
for one day as studies show that , you can lie from 10 up to 200 times .
another study demonstrated that the unfamiliar people солгали three times in the first 10 minutes with each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where the need to exclaim " caught ! " , detecting lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the last six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
should not out of this draw the conclusion that the liars difficult to see and it is difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn how to identify lies - and which helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiation or management .
we know from studies that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie , which they say , often наглая . )
observe behind the asphyxia , the laughter , voice characteristics in your facility .
rats can fix the upper part of his body when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , to change its position in a certain way or to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have a sexual relationship with this woman ... miss lewinsky " or to repeat a complicated question entirely .
someone can use the " qualification language " , when answering a complex question : " well ... the truth ... how do i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magic tools , to expose the lies , but to master the skill can detection of deception .

i ask about this , because there are some of the devotion group ; fans live in the tension in the days before the show .
, thank you for that there have been with us and all of these early years .
some of the people , in the waiting for your concert , relate to him as a show of himself .
some of the biggest shows , that we played for the past , 21 , took place in the last two weeks .
the fact is that we really want to to play here .
how do you have learned about the of the costa rica , and its waves for the surfing ?

we rejoice in our удачам , and we 're very encouraged by the fact that we can continue to make music together .
we are happy drive on the places in the world , where we 've always wanted to go .
does that mean for you to be a significant part of a common heyday of grunge ?
we are good friends , with the boys from soundgarden , and mudhoney and alice in chains .
from time to time appears one team from one town , but it is far more oddly , when five or ten groups appear in the one time , in the same city .
i still play with some from them are from time - to - time .
also very strange that a group of like your remains together and in one and the same composition as a long time .
in the first place , i think that we were lucky , that we are still alive , and secondly , we care about others .
we trust each other 's music , and all the could not would be better .
we care about , not to be too long in the round , because it is easy to get involved in this game , large crowds , and the people who love your music .
how do you remember her other project , , manother ' love bone ? "
we were a group of almost three years and not released any album , up to the death of andy ( andrew ( woods ) .
this was a wonderful person , and we 're skuchaem on with it .
it is true that you are familiar with her work , particularly the eddie веддера , and that 's why you chose her to open ?
why do you constantly change the words in the yellow ledbetter at concerts ?
he sings , and , i think he uses her the first thing that comes to him in his head .
so many of them , because i can talk all day long about the басистах which i love .
i think , all we feel some alienated from the rest words of the grunge . the
at first , your music was more somber , but she now has become more than positive .
it 's interesting , as i think , in an album there are a few songs that may seem easier , but there are songs such as the end or just breathe , which are considered very grim , though they may sound a little bit of positively .
i think that when you grow , and in your life has been some sort of injury and you have lost family member or friend , these events are beginning to affect your creativity and your music , and those two songs , of course , reflect this to me .

if there is a theme , the decision or which cannot be taken after a short discussion under the influence of emotions , it is an energy policy .
it 's a healthy trend that the election meetings have become an occasion for reflection about share and the place , their nuclear energy .
france should to build its opinion on the objective facts and on the rational of data .
during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources , to continue electricity production all the time , not forgetting about the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalances - theme , which has disappeared from the environmental debate .
here 's why germany remains alone in their decision to abandon the nuclear - energy .
on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , the netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil , which is only a few of those who strongly continues to their projects .
though model germany , which is based on the renewable energy , sometimes cited as an example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives a 30 % of its electricity , it 's as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого due ; the wind , carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices 65 per cent , respectively , and 50 % higher than the average for europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the service of industrial equipment at the national territory , the french company 's benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
the price , which the majority of french refuse to pay more , because they do n't object to this type of energy in principle .

in france we have security body , which conducts , too , and transparent control existing energy centres , such as the фламанвиль .

device in the chernobyl reactor , and unforgivable human error led to a tragedy .
nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident , learned of the previous two .

then the administrative oppression of foreign students , which in the news release , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from may 23 ) , said that france " do n't need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see the burden for the french of the economy and immigration for the french of society .
francois hollande , in his program was confined to platitudes , saying that " joint work will help solve our immigration problem " .
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей last data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on the economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears for the influence of the immigrants based on the view that they are able to replace the local workers , especially low - skilled , provoking cut wages .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor force , and the most qualified , in the dynamic sectors , where training is not connected with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there is a lack of анестезиологов , complementarity , existing between local that the arrival of the immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect the wages of local workers .
and this is without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalized immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all are based on immigrants ) .
according to the labor organization , in germany , for example , the immigrant , arriving at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring the budget net profit ( revenue minus costs ) in an average of 150 000 euros .
mentioned teeth who have used to scare immigrants , have given exactly the opposite effect .
democracy - is fragile and precious acquisition ; but also at the same time .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over their enemies , enough to arrange a voting and make it so directly , as far as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a sine qua non condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of suppression " , as republican once - philosopher etienne вашро said .
the european crisis , which we are experiencing , " this is an economic crisis , but first , this is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy .
we do n't win anything , demanding a series of national referenda , organized as needed and the хаотическом fine .
no , we are dreaming not of the blade the guillotine , but on the implementation of - the joint , clear and constant - choice and democracy , this time on a pan - european level .
the entire europe submits to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from their weakness , and from lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty europe , but all of europe entirely gradually loses its sovereignty , and each of its nations along with it .
because only collaborative effort of the europeans will be able to reduce the severity of debt each , free markets and to prepare for future , investing in him .
after a long discussion this proposal the socialists and jacques delors all now , require the european economic government .
but represent it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in the life граздан , " it 's another madness and a stalemate .
to install the republic of france , needed to " create " the republican .
it might only be done through the creation of a more democratic europe on the political level , real people 's european sovereignty .

analysis of the incidents calls pointed to several interlocutors , had in mali , niger and nigeria 's .
" this is a step forward , but there is no doubt , to wait for more reliable evidence , before we talk about operational cooperation between aqmi and boko haram . "

she aims mainly in on the of the church , bars and the law enforcement authorities .
in the past christmas , she took responsibility for the share , resulting in which 80 people were killed in джосе , and then again for one in abuja .
in the united nations ' august local representation would become their the first international goal .
today , when aqmi strengthened in mali and niger , and the somalis of al-shabaab in kenya , the boko haram poses a new threat to the continent .

jon huntsman , former obama ambassador to china and the only one candidate , the complex foreign policy , could n't overcome position , that appeasing emotions .
but the huntsman , who is kept in the bottom of the ratings , was неуслышанным .
romney also promised the military strikes against iran , if penalties would not be able to stop its nuclear program .

сигароообразный the handset is within a 1 - meter diameter pipeline and pushed forward the flow of gas .
gas pipeline was designed to work in for 50 years , without the need for the slightest repair .
these five companies have created the joint venture , called the northern stream , which had been ordered to build and operate gas pipeline .
then gazprom gave the company in rent on the twenty - five years with the possibility of extension of the entire volume of gas .
funding for natural gas pipeline was provided on 30 % of the shareholders , and the 70 % of bank credit .
comes out from the the baltic sea pipeline in lubmin on a sandy beach , mulberry , coniferous trees .
sensors measure pressure , temperature and specific characteristics of gas , before siphoned his in the german gas pipelines .
on full power it would be 3 million per hour , and in 2012 , $ 6 million .
